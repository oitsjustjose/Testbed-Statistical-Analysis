# R Statistics Assignment



##Your Tasks

1. Install R on your machine
2. Run the demo code (`how-to.r`) in R using the command `r -f how-to.r` or [R-Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/).
3. Write a new file named `tasks.r` which:
   1. Reads in the dataset (exactly like in `how-to.r`)
   2. Finds the variance of the `hit_counts` column
   3. Finds the standard deviation of the `hit_counts` column. Standard Deviation is equal to $\sqrt{variance}$ , so you can find this two ways:
      1. Find the square root of the variance from step 2
      2. Use the built-in R command
   4. Find the frequency of each type of label from the `label` column -- you **will not** and **should not** need to install a library to do this!



### You may need to use Google for these!

If so, that's perfectly fine! That's what we do as "professional" programmers, so we understand that not everything is straight forward
